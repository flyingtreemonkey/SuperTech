FINAL SUBMISSION USEAGE INSTRUCTIONS

In order to have this work locally, the user needs to have a repository set up locally to query against for the login information.

This would necessitate changing several lines that relate to file operations and the string for establishing the SQL connection

 return "Host = localhost; Username = postgres; Database = supertech; password =sophie";
 would need to be changed
 
 the output file would also need to be changed
 
 this.application_information = new StreamWriter("C:\\Users\\Sophie\\Desktop\\application" + todays_date + ".txt");
 
 Pleae consult the data_base_statements.txt to establish the create table statements locally
 
 INSERT INTO Managers (manager_id, manager_password) VALUES ('abcde', 'abcde'); 
 
 Would replicate the necessary manager login information to start using the application
